Windows Instructions

Download the file above, and save it somewhere, then double click on it. (1) Click "Run" then choose the installer's language and click OK (2). Make sure you have at least 80MB of free disk space in the location you select. If you want to leave the bundle on the computer, saving it to the Desktop is a good choice. If you want to move it to a different computer or limit the traces you leave behind, save it to a USB disk.

Click Install (3) Wait until the installer finishes. This may take a few minutes to complete.


Once the installation is complete, click Finish to launch Tor Browser's wizard.

Once you see Tor Browser's wizard click Connect

Alternatively, you can launch Tor Browser by going to the folder Tor Browser which can be found at the location you saved the bundle at (Default: Desktop) and double click on the Start Tor Browser application.

Once Tor is ready, Tor Browser will automatically be opened. Only web pages visited through Tor Browser will be sent via Tor. Other web browsers such as Internet Explorer are not affected.

Once you are finished browsing, close any open Tor Browser windows by clicking on the Close button (×) (6). For privacy reasons, the list of web pages you visited and any cookies will be deleted


To use Tor Browser again, double click on the "Start Tor Browser" application.

Remember that Tor anonymizes the origin of your traffic, and it encrypts everything inside the Tor network, but it can't encrypt your traffic between the Tor network and its final destination. If you are communicating sensitive information, you should use as much care as you would on the normal scary Internet — use HTTPS or other end-to-end encryption and authentication.
